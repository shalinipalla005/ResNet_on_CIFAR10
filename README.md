# ResNet Implementation

This repository contains implementation of ResNet (Residual Networks) for deep learning tasks.

## Description
ResNet is a deep convolutional neural network architecture introduced by Microsoft Research. It is widely used for image classification tasks due to its ability to train very deep networks using residual learning.
### Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition  

This repository contains an implementation and analysis of **Deep Residual Learning** based on the seminal paper by **Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun** from Microsoft Research. The work introduces **Residual Networks (ResNets)**, which allow training of **ultra-deep convolutional neural networks** by reformulating layers to learn residual functions instead of direct mappings.  

### üìå **Key Contributions:**  
- **Residual Learning Framework**: Instead of learning a direct transformation, layers learn residual functions with identity mappings.  
- **Deeper Networks Without Degradation**: Enables training of networks with **152+ layers**, outperforming previous architectures like VGG.  
- **ImageNet Performance**: Achieved **3.57% top-5 error**, winning the **ILSVRC 2015** classification challenge.  
- **Generalization to Other Tasks**: Improved object detection and segmentation on **COCO & PASCAL VOC** datasets.  

### üìÅ **Contents:**  
- üìú **Paper Summary**: Overview of ResNet architecture, training methodology, and results.  
- üìä **Experiments**: Comparisons with plain networks, CIFAR-10 benchmarks, and optimization insights.  
- üñºÔ∏è **Model Architectures**: Implementations for ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation**: Training details, batch normalization, weight initialization, and hyperparameter choices.  

### üèÜ **Results:**  
- **ResNet-34 outperforms plain networks of the same depth.**  
- **ResNet-152 generalizes well to multiple vision tasks.**  
- **Optimization is more efficient using identity shortcut connections.**
